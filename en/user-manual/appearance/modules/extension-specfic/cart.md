###Modal after add to cart###

Since Arastta 1.3 version, instead of redirecting the customers to the Cart page, Arastta displays a cart module as modal after adding a product to the cart. Customers can decide to continue the shopping or go to the Cart page or go to the Checkout page by clicking the buttons in the modal cart module.

You need to choose **Yes** for ***Modal after Addtocart*** option to use the module as **Modal after add to cart** function.
