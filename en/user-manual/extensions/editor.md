Editor
==========

Since Arastta 1.3 version, thanks to **Editor** extension, it's possible to choose your desired editor as default for your store. And Arastta comes with 2 different editors out of the box: **TinyMCE (Default)** and **Summernote**.

You need to enable at least one of them, thus they will be available in the store's settings to choose as the default editor.

In your admin panel, click on the cogs icon at the top right of the page to open configuration menu of your Arastta and navigate to **Extensions** > **View All...**.

All available extensions will be listed on the page and you can look for editor extensions in this list. An easy way to find editor extensions specifically is to filtering the extensions. To filter, first, choose **Type** from the filter area at the top of the page.

Then you can click in the search field, a dropdown list will be opened which lists all available extension types and choose **Editor**. The page will be refreshed and all editor extensions will be displayed in the list.

You can enable all of them or the desired one.

Also, you can edit any of those extensions to change their settings according to your needs.
