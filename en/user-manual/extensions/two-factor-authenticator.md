Two-Factor Authenticator
========================

Since Arastta 1.5 version, Two-Factor Authentication is added as an extension type into Arastta Core and by default there are two authentication extensions available: **Google Analytics** and **YubiKey**.

Please refer to [How to Enable Two-Factor Authentication](https://arastta.org/docs/how-to/how-to-enable-two-factor-authentication) article for the integration details.
