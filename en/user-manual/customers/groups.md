Customer Groups provide a greater organizational scheme for the customer list. This is helpful in selecting customer groups for discounted products and specials in the store; and for sending out emails to select customers.

### Using Bulk Actions

Bulk Actions describe the process to be performed on particular Customer Groups. These Actions can be performed on one, or more Customer Groups, at one time, if those Customer Groups have been previously selected. Bulk Actions are available, when appropriate, as choices in the Actions pulldown box, above each Table. There is only one Bulk Action allowed, the **Delete**.</li>

### Adding a new customer group

The default customer group for Arastta is called "**Default**". To create a new customer group name, go to the **Sales > Customers > Customer Groups** page. Above the list, click the "**Add New**" button. You will be directed to a page where you can fill in information about the customer group. You can provide a "Customer Group Name" and a "Description" for the group. Within this group, you can approve or disapprove customers logins into their store account. There is also an option to allow the customer to select their company no. or Tax ID. The sorting number determines the position of this group among other customer groups.
