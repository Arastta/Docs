Weight Classes
==============

Similar to length classes, weight classes are used to assign weight specifications to products in the [Data tab](docs/user-manual/catalog/products/data). The following information is required to create a new weight class:

- **Weight title**: The name of the weight measurement (i.e. Kilogram)
- **Weight unit**: The unites of measurement (i.e. kg)
- **Value**: Set 1 for the default value.Every value added to other weights, such as g, will need to be relative to that value. There are 1000 g in 1 kg, so the value of g would be set to 1000.
