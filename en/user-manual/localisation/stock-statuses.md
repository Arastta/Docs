Stock Statuses
==============

In this section you may create **Out of Stock** statuses to be displayed on the product page when a product is out of stock. The stock status name is arbitrary.

The default stock status for **Out of Stock** products can be edited under the option tab in [Settings](docs/user-manual/system/settings/option). The specific **Out of Stock Status** for a product can be edited in the **Data** tab in [Products](docs/user-manual/catalog/products/data).
