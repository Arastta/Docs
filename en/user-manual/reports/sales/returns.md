Returns Report
==============

The Returns Report can be accessed through **Reports > Sales > Returns**. The returns report shows how many returns were requested within a given time frame. The returns information is displayed in either daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly increments depending on which option you select in the "Group By" drop box.

The Returns Report displays the following information:

- **Date Start**: The date of the first day of the week tracked (if set to week in Group By)
- **Date End**: The date of the last day of the week tracked (if set to week in Group By)
- **No. Returns**: The number of return requests submitted or created between the date start and date end.

The Filter option can display the return information within a certain space of time using Date Start or End, or by return status.
