Just upload the ZIP file from the **Marketplace > Extension Installer** page. The ZIP file must contain an "upload" folder with the files to be uploaded. The installer does also show the files that will be overwritten, in case there is any, before it runs the extension.

##Multiple Theme per Store

Sometimes, especially when you have multiple stores and lots of product categories from different types, you may want to use different themes per store. For example let's say you have a clothes store and you sell clothes for women, men and children. You want to assign different themes for each store (women, men, children) with different styling and colors.

Just navigate to **System > Settings** page and assign your default template (store wide). Then navigate to **System > Store** and assign different themes for each of your store.
