My images are not uploading.
==================

Please check the following:

1. Make sure your image directory is writable.
2. Make sure you don't have display parse time on.
3. Make sure your web hosting does not include and hidden tracking scripts. Hidden tracking may that interfere when trying to send a upload response to your browser.
4. Make sure you have a php tmp folder where the image will be temporarily stored until its moved to the image directory.
5. Make sure you have the right permissions setup on your image directory. It should be 755 or 777. You can do this using chmod.
