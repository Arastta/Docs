How to enable Google reCAPTCHA?
===============================

Arastta is fully compatible with Googleâ€™s  reCAPTCHA and we encourage you to enable it on your Store as a measure against bot.

To enable and configure reCAPTCHA for your store, follow the steps provided below:

###STEP 1: Generate the Public and Private keys

In order to activate reCAPTCHA you will need to generate two keys. They are randomly generated strings called **Public** and **Private key**.  You can generate them on the official [reCAPTCHA](http://www.google.com/recaptcha) website.

Select the Get reCAPTCHA option at the top right corner.

This will direct you to a registration form that you must fill to continue:

**Label**: This will make it easier to identify the website

**Domains**: Put your domain name here. Your registration will be restricted to the domains you enter in this field.

**Owners**: The email account of the owner of the domain.
