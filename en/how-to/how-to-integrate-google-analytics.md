Google analytics helps you track the activity on your website. You can get a better idea of the traffic and conversion rate of your website. To start tracking your website’s traffic in-depth you will need a tracking ID. You can obtain this tracking ID by registering on the official [website](http://www.google.com/analytics/).

To Implement Google Analytics with your Arastta Store, you need to complete the following steps:

###STEP 1: Obtaining a Tracking ID

Select the **Sign in with Google Analytics** option and then click **Sign up**.
