Customers vs Users
==================

Customers are those who just purchase in your shop. See [Customers ](docs/user-manual/customers/overview/)for more information.

Users are those who manage your store, of course that they can also be customers. See [Users ](docs/user-manual/system/users/overview/)for more information.
