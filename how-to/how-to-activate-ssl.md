How to activate SSL?
====================

With sensitive customer and payment information being handled by your store, it is critical that you are able to secure that important information as it travels between web server and browser. As a result of this need, many store owners turn to [HTTPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure) for additional security. A [SSL certificate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) needs to be obtained and installed in your server before you can enable SSL for your store.

Once the SSL certificate has been installed, go to the [Security](docs/user-manual/system/settings/security) tab under your store's settings in your admin panel and find the **Use SSL** option. It allows you to enable SSL in your Account & Checkout pages, catalog wide and all of the store.
