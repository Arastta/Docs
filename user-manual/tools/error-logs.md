Error Logs
==========

If a user experiences an error in the store, the error will be displayed in an error log under System > Error Logs. This section can be used by web developers to track errors in coding for the store. The error log can get very full over time, so it is a good idea to clear the log from time to time. Pressing "Clear Log" will clear the list of errors.
