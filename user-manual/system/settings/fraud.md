The Fraud tab under Settings allows you to sign up to use the MaxMind Fraud Detection System for Arastta. Visit [MaxMind](http://www.maxmind.com) for more information.

Arastta supports the highly recommended minFraud service provided by the company MaxMind. Screening over 50 million transactions per month, MaxMind is the industryâ€™s leading provider of online fraud detection tools. With its network of trusted IPs minFraud can isolate potential fraudulent cases by scoring the chance of a transaction being a fraud. The user can decide the score-frame in which transactions should be considered fraud and not be completed.
 
To activate the minFraud for your Arastta store, you will need to get a MaxMind License Key via the official [website](https://www.maxmind.com/en/request-minfraud-service-trial) of the company. Here you can sign-up for a free trial account that contains a license key and 1,000 free queries for the standard service as well as 100 free queries for the premium service. You will need an email account associated with your company/domain name in order to pass the security measures of the registration form. 
 
Now you will need to login to your admin dashboard and navigate to **System>Settings**.
