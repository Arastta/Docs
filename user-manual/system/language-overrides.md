Language Overrides
==================

As Joomla veterans, we love its Language Override feature as it saves a lot of time. You can change any language text on the fly without hacking files and updates won't affect your change in any case. You can search and filter any string with ease. Also, the changes are stored in files which makes no affect to the performance.
