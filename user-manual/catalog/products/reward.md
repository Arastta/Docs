Reward Points Tab
-----------------

Reward points is a feature of Arastta that assigns customers "loyalty points" for purchasing products from the store. Customers can use these acquired points as a currency to purchase products from the store. You can assign this product a certain number of reward points required for a customer to purchase it with. If you don't want to allow this product to be bought with reward points, you can simply leave this area blank.
