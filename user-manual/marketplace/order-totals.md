Order Totals Extensions
-----------------------

You can manage the order total extensions used for orders under Marketplace > Order Totals. These totals are extra fees that are added to the total sum of an order in the store's shopping cart. For more information on order totals, visit [Orders](docs/user-manual/sales/orders). The order total extensions below are included with the Arastta package.
